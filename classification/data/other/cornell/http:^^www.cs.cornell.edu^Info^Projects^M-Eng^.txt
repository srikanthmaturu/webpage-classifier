spring find interesting projects require knowledge look extending course project m eng project best way get background project proposals claire cardie build number statistical models language processing used tasks part speech tagging word sense tagging natural language text evaluate models testing performance corpus real world text comparing results performance existing language learning system relies instead symbolic machine learning techniques note knowledge linguistics required language acquisition system uses symbolic machine learning techniques perform number disambiguation tasks natural language texts word level e g decide appropriate meaning part speech word given context project would involve extending system handle number higher level disambiguation tasks like deciding
