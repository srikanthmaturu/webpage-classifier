general information mentioned get compiler editor linker debugger bulk course work need ansi c compiler plus associated editor linker debugger usually components bundled one package microsoft visual c program used sieg pc large enough msvc strongly recommended however takes quite bit disk space runs best fast cpu msvc available university bookstore plus tax tried unable arrange even better discount

price planning continue cse also want c compiler symantec c macintosh called think c includes think c well c associated tools university book store student price products installed sieg lab probably safe bet home use version latest version power mac using version lab yet know whether version work smoothly version many people think metrowerks codewarrior even better system although switching files symantec systems labs fully automatic whatever buy strongly held opinion first rate symbolic debugger extremely valuable class subsequent work later graphics assignments find impossible use dos based products difficult impossible use older versions borland microsoft compilers borland prior version microsoft prior version date students much luck symantec c product windows d suggest avoid unless already buying computer product find compatibility existing system go store know least computer cpu type speed memory size available hard drive space operating system software including msvc requires cd rom installation read package label carefully caveat emptor might also able use c compilers campus unix machines think lack suitable graphical user interfaces debuggers huge obstacle particular limited use later graphical homeworks want buy compiler write edit programs almost computer simple text editor word processor saving file plain text may let bulk typing home bring file lab testing may take little experimentation figure indentation tabbing line breaking appropriately general tabs avoided different ways displayed different contexts particular see may different displayed print output turned transfer files many assignments provide files sample code skeleton solution test data etc expect provide files us solutions outgoing file transfer options bring disk lab use netscape comparable browser turn files bring disk lab use netscape note ibm compatible file transfer issues complicated slightly fact ibms macintoshes use different file formats lab macintoshes apple file exchange software installed read write ibm format floppies occasional troubles still arise mac file transfer see downloading macintosh binaries information downloading macintosh files without visiting lab summary short possible work outside sieg lab reasonably careful setting course would preclude possibility expect headaches unfortunately may difficult find help certainly know everything every combination hardware software light strongly recommend first assignment least lab graceful fallback case always allow ample time final testing debugging electronic turn case bugs incompatibilities
