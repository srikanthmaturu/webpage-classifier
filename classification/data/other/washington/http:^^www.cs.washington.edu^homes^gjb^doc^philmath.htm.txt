origins notion number farmer crow farmer wanted shoot crow eating crop went hid behind tree waiting crow come unfortunately crow saw hide behind tree wouldn return d seen farmer rifle leave farmer figured would trick crow wife went hid behind tree farmer sent wife back inside clear view crow crow wouldn come farmer left well crow could apparently tell difference one two people farmer repeated attempts three four five six seven friends brought seventh friend sent seven friends away tree crow come hiding point farmer promptly shot crow point although crow could distinguish one seven seemed though couldn tell difference seven eight individuals could count high seven since six talons could remember number people equating person talon thinking one two three four five six since seven eight people equate indistinguishable crow counting counting rests correspondence mapping elements two sets example stones used count sheep set talons however exhausted seventh person since talons correspond last person usually correspondence set concerned size one set index set numbers canonical universally accepted index set english numbers infinite based number decimal french numbers based babylonians used base time circle divided multiples also altered number system simplify calculations within different applications important distinction counting comparing relative size cardinal numbers tell size ordinal numbers used counting counting order significant cardinal numbers order irrelevant english make semantic distinction two types numbers fifth ordinal number expressing ordered position five cardinal number expressing magnitude greek development math thales credited beginning greek mathematics gave math position separate science area discourse flowering pythagoreans pythagorean ideas dominated mathematical thinking pythagoreans represented coherent body mathematical doctrines believed number rules universe made distinction math physics different areas mathematics primarily concerned study properties counting numbers believed measurements could expressed terms natural numbers ratios natural numbers called rational numbers developed number theory primes relative primes amicable numbers etc applications eg harmonics developed geometric theorems ideas proportions insistent mathematical ideas required proofs thought numbers concrete representations figures points developed figurate numbers eg square numbers triangular numbers etc three important pythagorean beliefs agreed babylonian assumption commensurability geometric measurement rational multiple standard unit thought space ultimately discrete separable nothing everything atomic parts believed continuity implied infinite divisibility downfall pythagoreans crisis commensurability false found irrational numbers commensurability true must equal p q p q natural numbers proof commensurability false assume p q p q set natural numbers reduce p q lowest terms done fraction p q p q thus p even number equal twice integer p p also even even sqaures roots even p k k set natural numbers k q k q k q thus q even q even q p even thus share common factor however contradicts step p q reduced lowest terms thus assumption p q false first recorded use reductio ad absurdum proof b infinite divisibility discreteness seem inconsistent zeno paradoxes motion main paradoxes attack philosophical theories motion parallel pythagorean view reality paradox arrow impossible arrow move instant time arrow travels space thus stationary interval time continuum instants arrow doesn move instants thus doesn move entire interval either thus pythagorean world view internally inconsistent greek reaction downfall plato isolate defeat problem stressed separation geometry number two separate branches mathematics thus isolating math study physical world altogether thought mathematics belonged realm ideas forms believed abstract notions without physical counterparts abstract things comprise mathematical reality thought abstract reality mathematics completely precise structured abstract real concrete illusory b aristotle gives much precise account nature collections manifolds gives much precise account nature continuity discrete aristotle definition continuity things together place re one primary place apart different places things contact edges place thing succession something nothing similar kind contiguous succession succession along contact continuous contiguous extremities one contained one another continuous implies shared merging edges isomorphisms basic continuous manifolds e space time motion isomorphic flowing motion basic idea aristotle continuity different pythagoreans view aristotle pointed problem zeno paradox due infinity aristotle analysis infinity get point requires infinite divisions line anything short infinite divisions continuous magnitude infinite divisions possible thus get point line completed infinity incomprehensible impermissible notion aristotle potential infinity permitted idea completed infinity based existential claim would exist point potential infinity instead contains existential claim finite number divisions made line without exhausting magnitude aristotle believed proof methods may usable different contexts thought patterns reasoning discussed science could organized according acceptable patterns reasoning aristotle invented logic fact basic categorization logic defined study late th century basic idea reasoning always requires starting point aristotle believed science made statements science basically inferring conclusions propositions aristotle showed inferences valid fallacious analyzed structure statements components inferences aristotle also introduced idea deduction one infer new statements building upon accepted past truths technique problem infinite regress hence developed postulates axioms serve foundation postulates axioms accepted true without requiring proof statements science must proven true using postulates axioms previously proven true statements aristotle thought concepts required definition hierarchy existed concepts defined specializations broad concepts example square could defined rectangle four equilateral sides example square species broad genus rectangle infinite regress problem necessitating fundamental concepts aren defined eg geometric point concepts constructions combinations specializations etc fundamental concepts however defining concept wasn enough aristotle required one must also show instantiation new concept exists thus fundamental undefined concept requires existence postulate since existence proven c mathematicians reaction downfall eudoxes euclid eudoxes theory proportion four magnitudes said ratio first second third fourth equimultiples whatever taken first third equimultiples whatever taken second fourth former equimultiples alike exceed alike equal alike less latter equimultiples x y kind magnitude z w also kind magnitude necessarily kind x y though x y z w mx ny implies mz nw mx ny implies mz nw mx ny implies mz nw m n note eudoxes theory proportion non numerical describes basic notion proportionality prove areas triangles equal heights proportional lengths bases words given abc ade show area abc area ade bc de proof given m n must show m aabc n aade m bc n de m aabc n aade m bc n de m aabc n aade m bc n de replicate segment bc left b n times replicate segment de right e m times see figure thus bnc n bc dem m de aabnc n aabc aadem n aade theorem says two triangle share altitude whichever larger base larger area likewise smaller equal thus m bc n de m aabc n aade m bc n de m aabc n aade m bc n de m aabc n aade incorrect proof choose bc p de q see figure divide abc p triangles base ade q triangles base smaller triangle equal area total areas proportion error proof assumes existence false thus proof unsound based false assumption method exhaustion basic assumption magnitude subtracted part less

diameter see figure take circle inscribe regular polygon repeatedly double number sides inscribed polygon see figure given small eventually get inscribed polygon p enough sides acircle apolygon suppose d d choose pn inequality holds thus p d d take p similar polygon inscribed theory proportions p p d d thus p p p implies p however p inscribed thus cannot greater area therefore supposition false parallel reasoning show d d also false reducing similar absurdity inequalities false possible relationship equality d d must true similar double use reductio ad absurdum method characterizes almost every geometric use method exhaustion resistance theorem due double use reductio ad absurdum positive results sterile method relationship proved must discovered another way mathematics simply

achievement organization needs postulate etc believed absolute separation discrete mathematics magnitudes example books state theory proportion magnitudes book states theory proportion numbers thomas heath wrote commentary elements wondered euclid didn use numbers special case magnitudes save repetition mathematicians made ontological change zeno paradox separation numbers magnitudes commonplace thus probably didn occur euclid numbers numerical entities special case magnitudes geometric entities elements full difficulties absolute separation resulted great deal repetition actual gaps perceived gaps archimedean postulate unstated assumption method exhaustion continuously mark segment ab direction c eventually ll pass c proven axioms gaps often due dependence pictorial diagrams assumptions seemed obvious needed explicitly stated example euclid forgot given line must two points given line exists least one point line euclid stated self evident assumptions perceived overstatement fifth postulate geometry parallel postulate straight line falling two straight lines makes interior angles side less two right angles two straight lines produced indefinitely meet side angles less two right angles see figure mathematicians objected postulate complex seemed derivable postulates however euclid right road non euclidean geometry hilbert axiomatization geometry david

klein belttrami independently proved hope contradiction neutral geometry negation parallel postulate showed straight euclidean geometry consistent must also true contradiction occur non euclidean geometry showed one could model non euclidean geometry inside euclidean geometry see figure circle whole plane chord line notice infinitely many chords lines intersect l thus parallel translation notions normal geometry interpretation hyperbolic plane euclid hyperbolic point point interior circle line chord circle given translation equivalence theorems postulates proven facts inspired hilbert remark study geometry consequence certain axioms interpretations unimportant klein said geometry really study algebra collection transformations remains fact geometries classified properties figures remain invariant transformations euclidean geometry characterized certain set invariants bottom line several ways consistently extend euclid first four postulates neutral geometry incompatible

work physics work physics empirical question happens geometries notion space meaningless game history concept number respect aristotelian idea completed infinity belong mathematics need introduce

mathematics physical situations nicholas cusa cleric write philosopher theologian th century liked infinity theology liked mathematics also wanted infinity brought back math thought triangle polygon fewest sides circle polygon sides infinitely many sides infinite cannot made bigger infinitesimal cannot made smaller mathematicians didn buy valerio stevin applied mathematicians stevin interested problem calculating fluid pressure vertical damn assumed damn made thin rectangles used known formulas relationship area volume polygons rotated thin strips area damn valerio developed similar applied methods using thin strips formulas derived treated delivered independently mathematics next step use way thinking inside mathematics cavalieri introduced thin strip indivisible mathematics plane strip thought infinitely many parallel indivisibles etc cavalieri principle one move indivisibles composing figure independently thus recreate figure two figures inside two parallel lines lines parallel two containing lines intersecting two figures cut chords equal lengths areas two figures cavalieri admitted methods clearly couldn rigorous rigor philosophers mathematics scientists cavalieri chief critic galileo galileo launched another attack notion infinity let think set natural numbers infinite set clearly larger set perfect squares however one one correspondence set natural numbers set perfect squares thus sets size paradox apparent thus mathematical notions apply infinity speak larger smaller infinity infinity magnitude collection aggregates thus galileo didn permit cavalieri method mathematics teach method students advised use solve problems pressure moving towards notion integration yet still viewed non rigorous theorem two solids equal altitudes sections made planes parallel

conjectured pattern must hold general notation wasn understood heterogenia notion geometric figures made lots figures lower dimensions methods use idea summing figures lower dimensions make

accept methods math used calculations infinitesimals vs indivisibles infinitesimals objects make figure size decreases number increases indivisibles basic atomic components geometric figure keppler gave proof area circle summing areas infinitely many small triangles heights equal circle radius h r sum base length circumference circle r thus area circle r r r geometric vs numerical methods cavalieri thought everything viewed geometrically vieta instead worked algebraic notions represented variable magnitudes letters described geometric figures equations would lead graph analytic geometry rejected cavalieri equation typical analytic geometry x x x terms corresponding geometrically volume area magnitude added summation unlike terms abhorrent cavalieri john wallis mathematician favor idea indivisible favor numerical methods attacked parallelogram problem previously mentioned introduced represent largest number thus according wallis since reciprocal largest number must smallest number wallis also conjectured integration formula also calculated area triangle bh summing infinite trapezoids wallis proofs used properties numerical progressions isaac barrow also rejected

within math recognized problems arise unclarity mathematicians relationship geometric methods numerical methods geometric methods allowed infinitesimally small imprecise led introduction arithmetic techniques study infinitesimal analysis give rigor return pythagorean ideas general overview reactions berkeley two philosophical lines math limited nature perceptual faculties intuitive perceivable world hence needed sophisticated theory perception problems math consistent perceptual abilities limit math intuitable math isn necessarily perceivable things governed abstract considerations rigor reasoning first reaction within philosophical community first idea imanual kant john stuart mill took view hand mathematics world supported second philosophical line called anti kantian direction opposed kant views reason direction related two developments pure math consistent alternative theories geometry showed mathematics presented abstract system without particular interpretation arithmetization mathematics proved math could reduced simply concepts natural numbers sets still resistance leaving intuition behind kronecker example advocated return intuitive basis mathematics another crisis abstract non intuitive mathematics internally inconsistent kant philosophy mathematics first thesis mathematics empirical world special one important way necessary properties world found mathematical proofs prove something wrong one must show world could different epistemological problem sciences basically generalizations experience provide contingent possible properties world could otherwise science simply predicts future mirror past mathematics empirical world usually methods deriving knowledge give contingent knowledge necessity pure mathematics gives us kant wants necessary knowledge empirical knowledge kant solves problem couple steps objects empirical world appearances phenomenon nature properties come know experiences things therefore kant said must become idealist object properties perceivable non experienceable properties objects built minds two forms intuition perception every perception shaped forms space time fact parts mind something mind picks experience thus empirical objects necessarily spaciotemporal objects come know spaciotemporal properties priori fashion studying spaciotemporal properties merely studying perceptual abilities mathematics simply science studies spaciotemporal properties objects studying nature space time thus mathematics studying abstract form perception infinitary ideas things subject perception kant makes distinction empirical intuition intuition senses always finite mathematics doesn deal pure intuition study possibilities empirical intuition finite limits introduced either direction thus mathematics allow division small intervals expansion large intervals means discuss smaller smaller quantities without introducing smallest quantities suppose want prove interval divisible following pick interval show divisible abstract actual size let represent notion perceivable interval two consequences kantian view thing unapplied mathematics math nature world abstract game exactly one right mathematical theory time space motion introduction notion limit instead talking infinitely small quantities think sequence smaller smaller quantities approaching number idea formulated independently bolzano cauchy late th century bolzano definition limit f x f x fn x given small quantity difference fn x fn r x gets stays smaller quantity n gets larger one one magnitude sequence gets close please today definition considered example internal criterion convergence cauchy definition limit successive values attributed variable approach indefinitely fixed value end differing little one wishes last called limit others difference definitions cauchy talks relationship end gives external criterion convergence arithmetization mathematics first step precise notion limit bolzano cauchy took care applications converging limit cauchy used limits describing notion derivative also introduced notion f x used aristotelian potential infinity instead actual infinity application notion continuous magnitude line function continuous function continuous x xx f x f x function whole continuous continuous points x thus notion continuity made arithmetic notion geometric notion cauchy tried using limit notion defining actually building irrational numbers limits series said irrational numbers limit sequence rational numbers example defined limit series cauchy right viewed number attempt show convergence failed definition limit defined irrational number convergence sequence definition limit required knowing limit advance order get closer closer cauchy assumed internal convergence established existence limit missing step defining sort entity limit sequence karl weierstrass added missing ingredient problem cauchy definition entity limit sequence let limit convergent series rational numbers set numbers series therefore set number hence limit set weierstrass also introduced definition limit exists implies back pythagorean idea single theory based numerical concepts weirstrass definition irrational depended series notion continuity reduced idea sequence rational numbers convergence richard dedekind took one step abstract showed definition irrational number made notion sets rational numbers eliminating need notions series convergence suppose set rational numbers cut set parts b exhausting set rational numbers either set set b none elements less elements b define abstract notion real number pair b sets example defined sets b set rational numbers x x b set rational numbers y y dedekind view abstract requires less conceptual machinery irrationals defined terms rationals sets view signifies retreat one crucial issue actually infinite sets must legitimate objects george cantor showed consistent theory infinite magnitudes exists defined natural numbers terms sets frege

r isomorphic q operations must defined preserve isomorphisms number one viewed element n different entity number one viewed element q different entity number one viewed element r ontologically basic objects mathematics n natural numbers sets two developments leads investigation notion infinite sets numbers infinite set number investigation nature natural numbers cantor cantor wasn concerned number instead wondered two sets objects number cantor therefore defined notion similarity size e equality cardinal two sets cardinality exists one one mapping exhausts similarly set cardinality cardinality set b exists one one mapping set b set exhausts b take e set even numbers n set natural numbers yet e n greater dedekind said infinite set set put one one correspondence proper subset cantor showed cardinality q cardinality n showing one one mapping proof write rational numbers shown figure rational numbers appear grid give order shown arrows orders rational numbers thus creating one one correspondence n first rational number ordering corresponds one second corresponds two etc denumerable set sometimes called enumerable one put one one correspondence set natural numbers cantor conjectured two types cardinal numbers finite infinite thus infinite sets would size however proved conjecture false set r larger n fact real numbers zero one total natural numbers diagonal proof assume list natural numbers left side give corresponding real number right etc two additional assumptions list completed every real number occurs list select r d d d d d let dn ann otherwise let dn words let r differ least one digit diagonal digit real numbers listed thus r different rational least one digit one one function n r exhausts n cantor noticed proof generalized given set k power set k p k k following true recursively set subsets set subsets even larger infinity implies exists infinite hierarchy larger cardinal numbers general power set set size greater cardinality cantor notation cardinal number natural numbers note notation linked fact p elements set function r r another reason notation haven yet proved set additionally cantor showed arithmetic infinities general operate cardinal number instead set theoretic operation sets cardinalities given numbers question remains type entity cardinal number distinction cardinal ordinal numbers unimportant finite numbers makeup coincides however infinite numbers distinction necessary cantor notion ordinality order type defined order preserving one one correspondence example set natural numbers order type set even numbers exists order preserving one one correspondence two sets e etc thus n q different order types elements q sequence next number thus two order types within denumerable sets perform arithmetic order types however set end unique predecessor different end thus commutative law doesn hold ordinal arithmetic order type negative natural numbers fact different order types denumerable sets outcome investigation infinity infinity longer taboo infinity accepted notion rich content central mathematics conceptual foundation calculus provided notions mathematics reduced ideas natural numbers possibly infinite set appeal whatsoever intuition mathematics anymore resistance leopold kronecker kronecker engaged criticism cantor thought cantor nonsense artificial work man mathematics reduced natural numbers sets however questions remain rigor behind natural numbers natural numbers reduction stop thus general move towards creating non intuitive conceptual framework natural numbers peano
