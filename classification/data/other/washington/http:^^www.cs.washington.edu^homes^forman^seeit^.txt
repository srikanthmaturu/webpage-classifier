constructing tools aid writing applications provide good interactive responsiveness even environments resource availability hard predict highly dynamic applications depend networking even indirectly networked file system may encounter several orders magnitude bandwidth variability mobile computing environment interface switch wireless wired connections operating systems effectively hide great network variation instead applications need flexible resource demands remain usable periods degraded service towards end dissertation research develops application framework runtime system express manage logical units resource demand concurrency progressive quality results gaining responsiveness user interface principally trading short term quality response introductory material please read abstract dissertation technical details yet available online pages longer maintained try demos re running x windows implemented prototype system test ideas consists set language extensions c pre processor convert multi threaded c code runtime system manage dynamic task graph written three interactive applications using prototype system library catalog database browser mandelbrot fractal generator web browser photo albums incremental resolution latter two available demonstration system resources plentiful easy get good response time resources scarce responsiveness support begins help demos designed exceed capacity local resources program would like run fractal explorer generates multiple mandelbrot fractals incrementally concurrently mouse position controlling priority among windows photo album browser downloads collection photographs progressively improving quality prioritization among pictures permit application connect display execute unix command xhost trouble cs washington edu enter display name e g xterminal u washington edu ip address e g tvtwm users demo tickles fatal bug tvtwm compiled dec alphas note applications meant run near user delay x server application large ll experience delayed responsive performance meaning still control priority etc slowly students sometime run large simulations departmental hosts bringing knees ll know things notice try fractal explorer demo first reading directions operating program notice zoom fractal still refining ability proceed incomplete result becomes important variability system response time increases today feature implemented tasks expected take long time system service time increases variability feature needs implemented tasks try zooming two fractal windows rapid succession simultaneously refining images move mouse one notice application concentrates resources selected fractal fractal may get cpu attention primary blocked o thread synchronization try point mouse outside windows observe two fractals improve resolution roughly rate roughly half fast try color enhancement feature first zoom part fractal little variation color quickly type c re color runs entire image histogram equalization function slow notice function run successive images produced fractal generator illustrate going inside application following rapid succession zoom area set toggle button open new window zooming type c new window display re colored version first window diagram illustrates task graph generated sequence user events green tasks added typed c output fractal image generator consumed display task first window re coloring task whose output goes second display task window series refined images passes data flow graph portion task graph becomes disconnected useful output display internal program variable runtime system prunes graph garbage collects associated storage happens zoom fractal still refining witness user interface except resource savings improve performance tasks care photo album browser demo suppose want show friend lunch particular photograph baby pull mobile computer access home photo album via wireless network given downloading baby pictures would take long time want photo album browser downloads displays images incrementally prioritizes bandwidth consumption among photos search picture imagine scenario use browser try find sunset photograph quickly keep mind internet provides higher bandwidth wireless network also effect prioritization becomes much pronounced desired priorities various network connections communicated wireless base station implemented experimental setup available demo web observe effect priority press return url window restart downloads quickly open two pictures move mouse later one observe selected picture gets refined faster obvious later refinements resolution finer refinement quadruples number pixels image application pre fetches one picture edge strip observe restart downloads wait resolution improvements note picture rightmost strip scroll right pictures notice difference resolution first picture right vs others george h forman gforman hpl hp com home page mail finger map weather cs dept uw live picture
