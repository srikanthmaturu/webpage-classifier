involves extending atm switches assist provision end end reliable multicast amount work must done senders receivers essentially independent size multicast involves addition several mechanisms atm switches one mechanism provides redundant acknowledgement suppression senders receive single acknowledgement every packet sent second mechanism allows multiple senders many many multicast send multi cell packets single virtual circuit without losing ability properly demultiplex receiver done using dynamic virtual circuit subchannel mechanism details found recently completed technical report set
