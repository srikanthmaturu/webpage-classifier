test results adam eck ld miller leen kiat soh aeck lmille lksoh cse unl edu avery hall lincoln ne tel fax brief introduction following report series tests deploying conference xp cxp wireless network university nebraska four phases tests phase preliminary tests april conducted determine drop rate existing wireless network using conference xp chat send presentation slides phase ii pgm implementation tests july august conducted implementing pgm protocol replace udp protocol conference xp phase iii pgm deployment tests september conducted determine pgm powered conference xp would work real classroom laptops competing wireless access points classroom phase iv minds deployment tests october conducted determine cxp powered minds would work real classroom wireless laptops note extensively tested minds deployed wired networks indeed minds deployed online bellevue university since may overall tests successful terms providing us insights continue refine revise designs implementations phase tests confirmed microsoft research observations wireless cxp deployment drop rate performances phase ii tests validated pgm implementation albeit small wireless environment phase iii tests verified correctness pgm implementation classroom size wireless environment venue participants simultaneously however phase iv tests successful initially hoped realize still first address specific installation problems minds minimize potential user errors database tracking problems analyzing logs solution ideas mind continue revise solutions continue phase iv tests near future phase preliminary tests tests confirm poor drop rate cxp wireless networks better performance g b chat messages suffer fewer drops powerpoint slides summary chat capability much better classroom presenter terms drop rates classroom presenter one slide good slides transmission seemed get significantly worse summary g connection better results rarely encountering drops slide pages b connection fared worse five runs least drop slide page know explain run things seemed go wiry sent event log tim chou review summary see b connection fared worse phase ii pgm implementation tests tests conducted pgm implemented used tests design pgm implementation evaluate late join feature statistics logging feature overall system seems work pretty well still doesn advantage old system receiving could done one socket least manage multiple threads anymore little bit error handling test application seems pretty robust message delivery seemed pretty reliable none dropped interference didn seem much problem either one point interference seemed make tablet pc could receive messages however second later suddenly received messages missed machines obviously weren correct order least received huge improvement udp small test machines local router results promising biggest concern still scalability since asynchronous methods still little thread handling runtime environment chat didn drop messages local screen streaming worked shared browser worked also loaded presenter ran test similar initially back march april machines received inks without dropping single one latency fast well finally minds capabilities loaded worked flawlessly well obviously test scenario pretty isolated since machines wireless behind simple home router results promising minutes seconds testing pgm packets sent back forth three machines packets nak packets negative acknowledgement meaning machine recognized missed packet nak responded ncf packet original sender letting nak sender know would resend packet rdata packet sent containing original message absolutely naks resulting ncf rdata packet meaning every time someone thought lost packet received later couple instances machine send several naks lost packet always received end nak responded responses lost like original packets given numbers odata original data packets sent machines resulting naks initial success rate nak packets rate resolution good numbers course lower implementation interference machines hopefully drop isn severe analyzing data dropped packets looked trends machines received packets first pgm guarantee overall ordering packets preserve order individual sender example say three computers sent packets following order desktop laptop tablet desktop laptop tablet desktop laptop tablet packets might show exact order receiver packets sender show order meaning desktop never come desktop tablet might come laptop interesting thing ordering scheme result pretty interesting things example say tablet dropped packet laptop waiting receive packet sending nak would continue receiving desktop one might expect interesting finally received dropped packet suddenly printed logged messages sent laptop since dropped packet words logs looked something like desktop laptop last packet received dropped one tablet desktop tablet desktop desktop tablet laptop received copy dropped packet laptop laptop laptop laptop sudden rush packets one sender common every single nak kind nice preserves order sender doesn penalize sender making every subsequent packet processed later tries catch summary ready begin testing larger environment machines phase iii pgm deployment tests comfortable local tests wanted test pgm deployment real classroom requested information services group department enable multicast us kauffman hall class jde h held results tests mixed observed several problems observed previous tests also observed erratic user behaviors caused deployment fail also went difficult time installing pgm functionality minds capabilities database driver student laptops different setups also fix security updates windows please see appendix installation guides students jde h end collected enough data say pgm successfully deployed first real test asked students install pgm functionality laptops see appendix tried running test laptops classroom running pgm ran big problem many students venue everyone could see worse yet distinct groups people visible across machines e wasn like half people visible half half found later analyzing logs thorough site testing windows security update kb caused pgm implementation fail testing packet sniffer determined naks never responded senders ncfs rdata packets caused receivers become stuck infinite loop requesting dropped packet causing participants time uninstalling security update fixed problem however thanks tim contact two members windows security team working solution summary overall things looking promising looking forward running extensive tests one problem encountered test student laptops going hibernation happened pgm sockets closed operating system difficult restore laptop came hibernation fact students would close cxp completely restart get back venue asked students change powersave options difficult coordinate change large environment phase iv minds deployment tests sure minds would work wireless networks minds makes extensive use database numerous tracking logging points involves large volume message exchanges thus built simple simulator test message sending receiving comfortable design tried deploy minds jde h class deployment failure report findings test version capability installed eight borrowed laptops six laptops six year old ibm thinkpads b two newer toshiba satellite tablets g laptops split two groups messages sent participants first group received participants first group true second group overlap groups teacher version also automatically started minds capability thirty students able run script connect unl cxp venue unfortunately point test started encounter problems around one quarter students received exception cxp tried load capability instance computers consulted error logs conferencexp api discovered students unable connect minds database two cases appeared students configured database connection system dsn machines properly however deleting dsn creating new one solved capability crash problem one machine sure whether user error insidious problem involving database connection saturated wireless network also problems capability started course caused capability form appear multiple times machines connected venue right two possible explanations happened first one curious students decided start capability see would happen might happened twice explain six plus versions capability running time second explanation problem late join pgm basically whenever user joins venue already capability running machine began capability sends information new user help start running capability well however late join might conflict approach late join works senders keep track last x messages x configurable send window new user joins receiver asks sender certain percentage x messages window percentage ranges original capability start one messages send window user automatically receive original start also one sender transmits new user joins causing two instances capability begin new user machine since two second one might cause new user become capability sender would result everyone else loading second instance well obviously users join venue effect cause even capability instances loaded behavior observed last test soh class unable confirm caused late join students simply started new instances told summary need address problems occur scale deal users non control environments
