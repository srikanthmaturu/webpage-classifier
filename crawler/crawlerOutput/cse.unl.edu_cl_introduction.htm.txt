whether get available patches depends current tolerance instability patches less well tested releases patches may occasionally introduce errors well fix problems however even correct patch may introduce instability patch enables feature previously ignored signals error correctly none previously signaled code may fail patch uncovered problem previously unnoticed suppose example patch causes
