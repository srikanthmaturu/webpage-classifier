similar distinguishable electronic tutor development efforts many educational simulation electronic tutor virtual classroom programs immex system www immex ucla edu developed ucla provide opportunities students participate active learning affinity accommodate types presentations assessments addition affinity adds customized support help students overcome misconceptions missing knowledge missing skills like immex affinity provides data allowing instructors understand students used system well learned affinity based lessons mathematics geosciences medical education shown positive learning achievement zygielbaum feese press system also distinguish student learning strategies used male female students zygielbaum grandgenett affinity based predicting likely misconceptions students misconceptions detected embedded assessments resolved remediation augmentation learning nodes lessons prepared breaking topic taught small learning experiences learning nodes lessons appear hierarchical network interconnected nodes node consists web based presentation material assessment student understanding material student completes one learning node directed subsequent node based outcome assessment student either directed continue learning progression diverted augmentation node outcome unanticipated covered succeeding node system notifies faculty member student faculty member enhances lesson adding new node interconnections better serve student bruning zygielbaum grandgenett students progress network learning nodes monitored web serving computer node outcome

assessments data presented graphically instructor understanding misconceptions basis affinity relates work james minstrell work facet innovations www facetinnovations com nsf funding minstrell developed methods identifying collecting misconceptions create diagnoser software system pursue research affinity affinity learning provided insight student behavior learning strategy offers potential aid educational research develop effective online teaching example past pi colleagues implemented response learning node assessment individually future building upon techniques developed identify matching dna sequences sequences learning nodes compared develop templates indicating student mastery correct identification misconception applied large sets students techniques could provide guidance present lessons knowledge skills required prerequisites based sequence information affinity learning nodes could reconfigured dynamically response observed student behavior techniques use intelligent software agents assessment education whether formative summative done level answers problems affinity learning system offers potential assess student actions process solving problems ncite entitled microassessment ability identify correct misconceptions level provide targeted immediate help students micro assessment prove useful many fields example mathematics instructors less interested answer problem way student got answer computer science concept recursion difficult students essence difficulty appears students attempt create recursive solutions programming problems affinity software
